# CMake Sandbox

Sandboxes to experiment with CMake features. This repository does not aim to put best practices example but rather proof of concepts.

And though it contains some explanation about the code, it does not aim to be introductory. For more introductory guides, please check [CGold guide](https://github.com/ruslo/CGold) or [ttroy50's code examples](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples).
